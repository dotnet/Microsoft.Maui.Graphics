	///     Metro samples, but the design is slightly improved in order to reuse
	///     components more easily.

	///     <see cref="TargetBase" /> is responsible for rendering, render target
	///     creation.
	///     Initialization and Rendering is event driven based, allowing a better
	///     reuse of different components.
