	/// <remarks>
	///     SharpDX CommonDX is inspired from the DirectXBase C++ class from Win8
	///     Metro samples, but the design is slightly improved in order to reuse
	///     components more easily.
	///     DeviceManager is responsible for device creation.
	///     TargetBase is responsible for rendering, render target
	///     creation.
	///     Initialization and Rendering is event driven based, allowing a better
	///     reuse of different components.
