# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Maui.Graphics! In this document, we'll outline what you need to know about contributing and how to get started.

## Prerequisites

### Code of Conduct

Please see our [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

### Contribution License Agreement

You will need to complete a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before any pull request can be accepted. Review the CLA at https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org. When you submit a pull request, a CLA assistant bot will confirm you have completed the agreement, or provide you with an opportunity to do so.

## Contributing Code

We are in the beginning phases of building up MAUI, but are still very excited for you to join us during this exciting time :)

### What to work on

Any issue that is not already assigned is up for grabs.

### Style Guide

Follow the style used by the [.NET Foundation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md), with two primary exceptions:

- We avoid using the `private` keyword, as it is the default accessibility level in C#
- We prefer hard tabs over spaces ([#52](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics/pull/52))

### Pull Requests

Please check the "Allow edits from maintainers" checkbox on your pull request. This allows us to quickly make minor fixes and resolve conflicts for you.

### Review Process

All pull requests must be reviewed by at least two members of the .NET MAUI team. We do our best to review pull requests in a timely manner, but please be patient! 

If major changes are requested, the contributor should make them at their earliest convenience or let the reviewers know they are unable to make further contributions.

If only minor changes are required someone else may pick it up and finish it. We will do our best to make sure that all credit is retained for contributors.
